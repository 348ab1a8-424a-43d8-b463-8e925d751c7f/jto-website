## Favorite Excerpts / Quotes

### 1
> *Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.
We concentrate on the people who ended up winning--the survivors--and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while
overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn't succeed.* (Pg. 24-25)

### 2
> *Furthermore, goals create an "either-or" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you
are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided.* (Pg. 26)

### 3
> *The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.* (Pg. 27)

### 4
> *Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today,
we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship,
or a sense of personal satisfaction.* (Pg. 48)

### 5
> *The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.* (Pg. 60)

### 6
> *Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location,
your pair it with a current habit.* (Pg. 74)

### 7
> *Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.* (Pg. 87)

### 8
> *If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable* (Pg. 90)

### 9
> *This is the secret to self control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.* (Pg. 95)
