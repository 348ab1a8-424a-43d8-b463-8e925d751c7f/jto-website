## Favorite Excerpts

### 1
> *Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.
We concentrate on the people who ended up winning--the survivors--and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while
overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn't succeed.* (Pg. 24-25)

### 2
> *Furthermore, goals create an "either-or" conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you
are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided.* (Pg. 26)

### 3
> *The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.
True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It's not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and
continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.* (Pg. 27)
