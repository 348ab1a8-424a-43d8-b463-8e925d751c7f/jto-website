Just an update on what's going on.

### Cleanup
- Got rid of some older repositories from my GitHub account.
	- These projects were older ambitions that lost their way.
	- These projects were pushed away and I no longer wish to maintain or revive them.

### New
- Started a new project, MoneyMapper.
	- Open-source personal finance tracker.
	- Going to use:
		- .NET 4.8 Framework
		- MySQL DB

### Other Stuff
- Halfway done reading Atomic Habits by James Clear.
- Took the weekend off to relax and spend time with the family.
- Still working on completing the ticket I got assigned at work.
	- Doing fairly well, just need to tidy up and get rid of some redundant code.
	- Hopefully I can integrate the functionality to UI soon.

Best,<br />
