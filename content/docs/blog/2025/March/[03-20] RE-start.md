***How many times have I started a blog and ended it?*** <br />
***How many times have I started a blog and then stopped updating it?*** <br />
***How many times have I thought about restarting a blog?*** <br />
***When was the first time I created a blog?*** <br />

I created my first blog when I was forced to in University. During that time, many aspiring Software Engineers, developers,
or whoever else that was into Computer Science and the like was following a trend. If you start a blog, you will become successful!

Well that was the wrong reason to start, you should start something because you found the need for it. If you don't have your personal reasons
or intentions to start something, there is no way it will become a part of you. However, for me, during this time, I have found success in what
I've done ever since graduating from University.

I will try and elaborate in another blog post.

Best,<br />
