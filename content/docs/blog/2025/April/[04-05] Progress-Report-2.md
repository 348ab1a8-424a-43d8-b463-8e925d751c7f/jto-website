Just an update on what's going on.

### Reading progress
- I don't remember the last time I actually finished a complete book.
- It's even more impressive I bought a book and finished it within a month's time!
- Atomic Habits by James Clear is now completely done, I've learned alot and will be trying to put what I learned into practice.
- However, I just got my second book Grit by Angela Duckworth.

### Other readings
- Just bought Pro C# 10 with .NET 6 by Andrew Troelsen.
- Did short research online and this book seems like my best bet to improve my understanding of C# and improve my programming knowledge.
- I am desprately avoiding any YouTube videos and/or courses as I remember during my University days of trying to start learning how to program.
	- "Tutorial Hell" is real and it fucking sucks to be in that rabbit hole.
	- So far reading books have been becoming more enjoyable. I feel annoyed not having time to read my books and I look forward to setting aside time to do so each day.

### Other Stuff
- Not much happened at work so far.
- The requirements weren't clearly defined for the project at work. So I've been revising and making additions to parts that I thought I was done with.
	- Kinda annoyed at that but that's how things are as a junior.
	- I don't have enough experience programming in the real world to ask the right questions yet.
- Starting to attend more meetings and becoming a part of the bigger picture at work now. It's been chaos trying to make time and get to those meetings.
- Also, I've noticed that switching between using a digital notebook to a more analog (paper/pen) approach have given me some benefit.
	- It's only been a week but I think I'll stick with it.
	- There is something about having it physically in front of me that gets my brain to utilize it more often.
		- This was a lesson taught in Atomic Habits!

Best,<br />
