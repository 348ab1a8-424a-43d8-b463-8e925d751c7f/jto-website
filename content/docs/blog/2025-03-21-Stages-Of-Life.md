***I did things because I had to, not because I wanted to.***

As a child, I was taught to do things because they needed to be done. I didn't care much as long as it made those
around me feel happy that it was done. This continued from then on, I became a people pleaser. What a terrible thing to become,
never thought for myself, just did what made other people happy.
