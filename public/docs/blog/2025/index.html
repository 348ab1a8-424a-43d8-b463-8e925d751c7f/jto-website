The diagonis before the surgery was the following.\nMaxillary hypoplasia Mandibular hyperplasia Facial and jaw asymmetry During the surgery, the surgeon also identified the following issues and corrected them immediately.\nRight maxillary sinus polyp Deviated nasal septum The first month of recovery was not as bad as I read online from other people’s experiences. Let me summarize the events up until this point as I am into the 2nd month of recovery now.\nDay 1 - 2 (Hospital Stay):\nMostly had issues with the bloody nose and congestion due to the dried blood in said nose. I had no sore throat, intense bruising, or significant pain. On a pain scale of 1 - 10, I had a 2-3 throughout the hospital stay. My pain was tolerable and I could go without ibrubophen during the night too as it was given every 6 hours.\nFirst Month (Home):\nGetting discharged was significant as I was able to rest peacefully without a nurse or some other person waking me up for a vital check. During this first month, I rested with my head elevated and dealt with the dreaded full liquid diet.\nThe first week was confusing as I was trying new recipes and figuring out what could be blended for me to take in with a syringe.\nAfter the second week, I had some frustration with the syringes as they become worn and unusable. The same foods I have been ingesting daily were starting to wear me down. What saved me during the next few weeks was buying canned food like Progresso to help with the flavor fatigue. Let me tell you, anything with cheese is a good choice.\nDuring this time, I only had 2 sets of rubberbands to secure my upper and lower jaw in place. No specific instructions other than wear them daily and take them off before eating or doing jaw exercises. At some point, I only wore them at night after brushing my teeth.\nAlso, if anyone reads this is thinking of getting jaw surgery. I recommend getting a waterpik to help with cleaning the teeth as the jaw does not have full range of motion to insert a toothbrush.\nSecond Month:\nOn May 30th during my follow-up appointment, my diet was advanced to a soft food no chew diet. Phasing out the full liquid diet foods and went straight to soft solids or something solid I could gulp down with soup. Having solid rice after a full month was one of the best moments of recovery. I have never missed rice that badly before.\nI also don’t have to wear any rubberbands anymore and can finally fit 2 fingers in my mouth. The goal is to fit 3 fingers in the mouth as that is normal range of motion. Jaw exercises every day will help me accomplish this. Other than that, I had no complications during the surgery or recovery thus far.\nBecame a Father linkImagine going into the hospital with 2 people and leaving with 3. Crazy to think about.\nAt the time of writing this, it has been 2 weeks and 4 days of being a Father. The ride has been bumpy at the beginning but I have finally settled into a flow state of being a parent.\nI won’t go too deep into this topic but will say Mother and Daughter are both healthy and doing very well.\nBest, Johnny\n"

It’s even more impressive I bought a book and finished it within a month’s time! Atomic Habits by James Clear is now completely done, I’ve learned alot and will be trying to put what I learned into practice. However, I just got my second book Grit by Angela Duckworth. Other readings link Just bought Pro C# 10 with .NET 6 by Andrew Troelsen. Did short research online and this book seems like my best bet to improve my understanding of C# and improve my programming knowledge. I am desprately avoiding any YouTube videos and/or courses as I remember during my University days of trying to start learning how to program. “Tutorial Hell” is real and it fucking sucks to be in that rabbit hole. So far reading books have been becoming more enjoyable. I feel annoyed not having time to read my books and I look forward to setting aside time to do so each day. Other Stuff link Not much happened at work so far. The requirements weren’t clearly defined for the project at work. So I’ve been revising and making additions to parts that I thought I was done with. Kinda annoyed at that but that’s how things are as a junior. I don’t have enough experience programming in the real world to ask the right questions yet. Starting to attend more meetings and becoming a part of the bigger picture at work now. It’s been chaos trying to make time and get to those meetings. Also, I’ve noticed that switching between using a digital notebook to a more analog (paper/pen) approach have given me some benefit. It’s only been a week but I think I’ll stick with it. There is something about having it physically in front of me that gets my brain to utilize it more often. This was a lesson taught in Atomic Habits! Best,\nJohnny\n",

Did short research online and this book seems like my best bet to improve my understanding of C# and improve my programming knowledge. I am desprately avoiding any YouTube videos and/or courses as I remember during my University days of trying to start learning how to program. “Tutorial Hell” is real and it fucking sucks to be in that rabbit hole. So far reading books have been becoming more enjoyable. I feel annoyed not having time to read my books and I look forward to setting aside time to do so each day. Other Stuff link Not much happened at work so far. The requirements weren’t clearly defined for the project at work. So I’ve been revising and making additions to parts that I thought I was done with. Kinda annoyed at that but that’s how things are as a junior. I don’t have enough experience programming in the real world to ask the right questions yet. Starting to attend more meetings and becoming a part of the bigger picture at work now. It’s been chaos trying to make time and get to those meetings. Also, I’ve noticed that switching between using a digital notebook to a more analog (paper/pen) approach have given me some benefit. It’s only been a week but I think I’ll stick with it. There is something about having it physically in front of me that gets my brain to utilize it more often. This was a lesson taught in Atomic Habits! Best,\nJohnny\n"

If you don’t have your personal reasons or intentions to start something, there is no way it will become a part of you. However, for me, during this time, I have found success in what I’ve done ever since graduating from University.\nI will try and elaborate in another blog post.\nBest,\nJohnny\n"

We concentrate on the people who ended up winning–the survivors–and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed. (Pg. 24-25)\n2 link Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. (Pg. 26)\n3 link The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. (Pg. 27)\n4 link Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Pg. 48)\n5 link The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. (Pg. 60)\n6 link Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, your pair it with a current habit. (Pg. 74)\n7 link Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. (Pg. 87)\n8 link If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable (Pg. 90)\n9 link This is the secret to self control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible. (Pg. 95)\n10 link One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. (Pg. 117)\n11 link We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire sucess ourselves. (Pg. 121)\n12 link Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment. (Pg. 129)\n13 link Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. (Pg. 131)\n14 link When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. (Pg. 143)\n15 link Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add much friction into your lifestyle. (Pg. 153)\n16 link Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. (Pg. 156)\n17 link The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. (Pg. 163-164)\n18 link When you automate as much as your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. (Pg. 174)\n19 link The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (Pg. 192)\n20 link *Simple bits of reinforcement can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable. (Pg. 192-193)\n21 link The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. (Pg. 201)\n22 link But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t meaasure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. (Pg. 203)\n23 link Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to others. (Pg. 210)\n24 link A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote. (Pg. 249)\n"

I didn’t care much as long as it made those around me feel happy that it was done. This continued from then on, I became a people pleaser. What a terrible thing to become, never thought for myself, just did what made other people happy.\nMy Early Life linkI define my early life where certain memories of mine clearly divide a before and after timeline. For me, anything from being born up until I had done homework outside my doorstep with some of my neighborhood friends. It was a study group and we had a great time. If I remmeber corectly, up until this point I was in the 3rd grade. This was the time where I made sure to do all my homework, get straight A’s, and do well in school.\nIt was up until the fourth grade where I needed to have a home desktop computer to do essay assignments at home or whatever reason it was to get a computer. This is where I learned about PC games, and played games with a friend from school. 2007 was a good year for RuneScape, and I could not stop playing it. Runescape after school, Runescape on the weekend, Runescape was all I thought about! Of course, I still made sure to complete all my homework and do well in school. As the years went by, I’ve played dozens of different PC games and it became part of my identity. I was a PC gamer and I enjoyed every second of it. My grades were okay in 5th grade to 6th grade, although I did have to call my best friend in the morning to rattle me the answers to the assigned math homework in the morning.\nMiddle School and High School both blew by fairly quickly. The routine did not change, weekdays play PC games after school, weekend play PC games all day \u0026 night long. Summer vacation came and went each year. The plan was to procrastinate and play videogames all summer long until the last week. Then during the last week, slam all the 5 books I pretended to read and write essays about them for the summer vacation reading assignment.\nThis was my routine, I had fun, and I loved every second of it.\nBest,\nJohnny\n"
