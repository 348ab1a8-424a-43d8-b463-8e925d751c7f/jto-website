Even if the project is an executable, can still be executed with the command dotnet .dll The dotnet.exe is actually copied to the build directory and renamed .exe which will then execute dotnet .dll. The *.exe is not even the actual project’s code, just a convenient shortcut to running your application. Even if the application is a single file that is executed directly. It’s only a packaging convenience. It contains all the files needed to run the application and sometimes the .NET runtime included. However, the code is still running in a managed container just as if it were published as multiple files. Assembly contains CIL (Common Intermediate Language) code. Assembly contains metadata that describes in detail the characteristics of every type within the binary. Contains a manifest that has information about the current version of the assembly, culture information, and a list of all externally referenced assemblies that are required for proper execution. Common Intermediate Language (CIL) link Sits above any particular platform-specific instruction set. C# compiler emits CIL, not platform specific instructions. For example, if you have a Calc.cs (Calculator class) that is compiled. It would produce a .dll assembly that contains a manifest, CIL instructions and metadata describing each aspect of the Calc and Program classes. Can output IL (Intermediate Language) of an assembly using ildasm.exe. Doesn’t matter if C# or Visual Basic or F#. You will find similar instructions when examining the CIL. Benefit is that it allows language integration. CIL to Platform-Specific Instructions link Done by being compiled on the fly by a JIT compiler (also named jitter). The .NET runtime environment leverages a JIT compiler for each CPU targeting the runtime, each optimized for the underlying platform. A single body of code can be efficiently JIT compiled and executed on machines with different architectures. Jitter has a built in cache to avoid recompiling CIL. For example, if a method was compiled and ran once, then was needed to run again. Can pre-JIT code using crossgen.exe. .NET Type Metadata link Job of the compiler to generate the assembly’s metadata. Describes every type (e.g. class, structure, enumeration) defined in the binary and the members of each type (e.g. properties, methods, and events). IntelliSense feature in Visual Studio is only possible by reading an assembly’s metadata at design time. Also, it is used by various object-browsing utilities, debugging tools, and the C# compiler itself. It is the backbone of numerous .NET technologies including reflection, late beinding and object serialization. Assembly Manifest link Metadata that describes the assembly itself. Documents all external assemblies required by the current assembly to function correctly. The assembly’s version number, copyright information, etc. The job of the compiler to generate the assembly’s manifest. Common Type System (CTS) link Type refers to a member of the set {class, interface, structure, enumeration, delegate}. Example: You have a class that implements a number of interfaces where an interface method takes an enumeration type as a parameter and returns a structure to the caller. However, only individuals who are deeply concerned with the inner workings of the CTS are those building tools and/or compilers that target the .NET platform. .NET Programmers need to learn how to work with the five types defined by the CTS in their language of choice. CTS Class Type link Cornerstone of object-oriented programming (OOP). May be composed of an number of members such as Constructors Properties Methods Events In C#, classes are declared using the class keyword such as // A C# class type with 1 method. class Calc { public int Add(int addend1, int addend2) { return addend1 + addend2; } } CTS Class Characteristics Is the class sealed? Sealed classes cannot function as a base class to other classes. Does the class implement any interfaces? An interface is a collection of abstract members that provides a contract between the object and object user. CTS allows a class to implement any number of interfaces. Is the class abstract or concrete? Abstract classes cannot be directly instantiated but are intended to define common behaviors for derived types. Concrete classes can be instantiated directly. What is the visibility of this class? Must be configured with a visibility keyword such as public or internal. Controls whether the class may be used by external assemblies or only from within the defining assembly. CTS Interface Type link A named collection of abstract member definitions and/or default implementations which are implemented by a given class or structure. Defined using the interface keyword. By convention, all .NET interfaces begin with the capital letter I such as // Usually decalred as public to allow types in other assemblies to implement their behavior. public interface IDraw { void Draw(); } On their own, interfaces have little use. When a class or structureimplements a given interface in its unique way, you are able to request access to the supplied functionality using an interface reference in a polymorphic manner. CTS Structure Type link A lightweight class type having value-based semantics. Structures are best suited for modeling geometric and mathematical data. Created using the struct keyword such as // A C# structure type. struct Point { // Structures can contain fields. public int xPos, yPos; // Structures can contain parameterized constructors. public Point (int x, int y) { xPos = x; yPos = y;} // Strutures may define methods. public void PrintPosition() { Console.WriteLine(\"({0}, {1})\", xPos, yPos); } } CTS Enumeration Type link Allows you to group name-value pairs. Example, if you were creating a video game application that allows the player to select from three character categories (Wizard, Fighter, or Thief). Rather than using numerical values to represent each possibility, you could build a strongly typed enumeration using the enum keyword. enum CharacterTypeEnum { Wizard = 100, Fighter = 200, Thief = 300 } By default, the storage used to hold each item is a 32-bit integer. Can be altered if needed. CTS Delegate Types link .NET equivalent of a type-safe, C-style function pointer. .NET delegate is a class that derives from System.MulticastDelegate, rather than a simple pointer to a raw memory address. Declared using the delegate keyword. //This C# delegate type can \"point to\" any method returning an int and taking two ints as input.\rdelegate int BinaryOp(int x, int y); Critical when you want to provide a way for one object to forward a call to another object and provide the foundation for the .NET event architecture. CTS Type Members link Most types take any number of members. A type member is constrained the the set {constructor, finalizer, static constructor, nested type, operator, method, property, indexer, field, readonly-field, constant, event} CTS defines adornments that may be associated with a given member such as Given a Visibility trait - public, private, protected. Declared as abstract or virtual abstract - to enforce a polymorphic behavior on derived types. virtual - to define a canned, but overridable, implementation. Configured as static or instance. static - bound at the class level. instance - bound at the object level. Intrinsic CTS Data Types link Well-defined set of fundamental data types. All .NET language keywords resolve to the same CTS type defined in an assembly named mscorlib.dll. CTS Data Type\tC# Keyword\r------------------------------------------\rSystem.Byte\tbyte\rSystem.SByte\tsbyte\rSystem.Int16\tshort\rSystem.Int32\tint\rSystem.Int64\tlong\rSystem.UInt16\tushort\rSystem.UInt32\tuint\rSystem.UInt64\tulong\rSystem.Single\tfloat\rSystem.Double\tdouble\rSystem.Object\tobject\rSystem.Char\tchar\rSystem.String\tstring\rSystem.Decimal\tdecimal\rSystem.Boolean\tbool Unique keywords of a managed language are simply shorthand notations for a real type in the System namespace. For example the following code snippet defines a 32-bit numerical variable in C#. // Define some \"ints\" in C#. int i = 0; System.Int32 j = 0; Common Language Specification (CLS) link The CLS is a set of rules that describe in vivid detail the minimal and complet eset of features of a given .NET compiler must support to produce code that can be hosted by the .NET Runtime, while at the same time be accessed in a uniform manner by all languages that target the .NET platform. CLS can be viewed as a subset of the full functionality defined by the CTS. The CLS is ultimately a set of rules that compiler builders must conform to if they intend their products to function seamlessly within the .NET universe. Each rule is defined a simple name (e.g. CLS Rule 6) and describes how this rule affects those who build compilers as well as those who interact with them. C# does define a number of programming constructs that are not CLS compliant. You can instruct the C# compiler to check your code for CLS compliance using a single .NET attribute. // Tell the C# compiler to check for CLS compliance. [assembly: CLSCompliant(true)] This instructs the C# compiler to check every line of code against the rules of the CLS. If violations are discovered, you receive a compiler warning and a description of the offending code. .NET Runtime link A collection of services that are required to execute a given compiled unit of code. .NET runtime provides a single, well-defined runtime layer that is shared by all languages and platforms that are .NET. Assembly vs Namespace vs Type link A convenient way to logically understand and organize related types. For example: System namespace System.Console from our perspective represents a class named Console that is contained within a namespace called System. However, .NET runtime only sees it as a single class named System.Console. The using keyword simplifies the process of referencing types defined in a particular namespace. using System; // The above statement enables the line of code below. Console.WriteLine(\"10 + 84 is {0}\", answer\"); // Otherwise, the code would have been written as. System.Console.WriteLine(\"10 + 84 is {0}\", answer\"); Chapter 1 Vocabulary link-\n"

What a terrible thing to become, never thought for myself, just did what made other people happy.\nMy Early Life linkI define my early life where certain memories of mine clearly divide a before and after timeline. For me, anything from being born up until I had done homework outside my doorstep with some of my neighborhood friends. It was a study group and we had a great time. If I remmeber corectly, up until this point I was in the 3rd grade. This was the time where I made sure to do all my homework, get straight A’s, and do well in school.\nIt was up until the fourth grade where I needed to have a home desktop computer to do essay assignments at home or whatever reason it was to get a computer. This is where I learned about PC games, and played games with a friend from school. 2007 was a good year for RuneScape, and I could not stop playing it. Runescape after school, Runescape on the weekend, Runescape was all I thought about! Of course, I still made sure to complete all my homework and do well in school. As the years went by, I’ve played dozens of different PC games and it became part of my identity. I was a PC gamer and I enjoyed every second of it. My grades were okay in 5th grade to 6th grade, although I did have to call my best friend in the morning to rattle me the answers to the assigned math homework in the morning.\nMiddle School and High School both blew by fairly quickly. The routine did not change, weekdays play PC games after school, weekend play PC games all day \u0026 night long. Summer vacation came and went each year. The plan was to procrastinate and play videogames all summer long until the last week. Then during the last week, slam all the 5 books I pretended to read and write essays about them for the summer vacation reading assignment.\nThis was my routine, I had fun, and I loved every second of it.\nBest,\nJohnny\n"

We concentrate on the people who ended up winning–the survivors–and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed. (Pg. 24-25)\n2 link Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment. You mentally box yourself into a narrow version of happiness. This is misguided. (Pg. 26)\n3 link The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. (Pg. 27)\n4 link Our prehistoric ancestors were paying attention to cues that signaled the location of primary rewards like food, water, and sex. Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Pg. 48)\n5 link The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. (Pg. 60)\n6 link Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, your pair it with a current habit. (Pg. 74)\n7 link Environment design allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it. (Pg. 87)\n8 link If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable (Pg. 90)\n9 link This is the secret to self control. Make the cues of your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible. (Pg. 95)\n10 link One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. (Pg. 117)\n11 link We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire sucess ourselves. (Pg. 121)\n12 link Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment. (Pg. 129)\n13 link Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities. (Pg. 131)\n14 link When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning. You want to be practicing. (Pg. 143)\n15 link Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because stopping doesn’t add much friction into your lifestyle. (Pg. 153)\n16 link Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. (Pg. 156)\n17 link The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. (Pg. 163-164)\n18 link When you automate as much as your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. (Pg. 174)\n19 link The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (Pg. 192)\n20 link *Simple bits of reinforcement can offer the immediate pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable. (Pg. 192-193)\n21 link The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. (Pg. 201)\n22 link But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t meaasure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. (Pg. 203)\n23 link Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to others. (Pg. 210)\n24 link A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote. (Pg. 249)\n"
